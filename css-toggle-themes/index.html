      <h1>Toggle themes with CSS</h1>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Toggling themes using global variables and CSS is a common approach in modern web development to switch between light and dark modes or
          other theme variations. </p>

        <p>By defining theme variables in CSS, such as colors, fonts, and spacing, developers can easily manage and switch themes. A global variable,
          often stored in JavaScript, tracks the current theme. When a user toggles the theme, JavaScript updates this variable and modifies the
          document's root element class or data attribute.</p>
        <p>
          CSS then applies the corresponding styles based on the active theme, allowing for a seamless and dynamic user experience. This method
          ensures maintainable and scalable theming across the application.
